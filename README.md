# BridgIt
<p>
                Coded in Java as the final pair programming assignment for my Fundamentals of Computer Science 2 class,
                <a href="http://www.lutanho.net/play/bridgit.html" target="_blank"> BridgIt is a 2-player game </a>, where the objective 
                is to bridge your sides together (left and right if player 1 or top and bottom if player 2). This game 
                may seem like Tic Tac Toe at first, aiming to connect your sides together, however, by blocking your 
                opponent repeatedly, you may be allowing for them to win. Unlike any other game that my partner and I 
                coded for this class, in order to detect if a game has been won, we had to utilize an algorithm. As 
                many programmers know, there are two main algorithms, Breadth First Search and Depth First Search 
                when searching graphs, however, neither are the most effective when searching if there is a connection 
                between two nodes. This is why we used an algorithm known as Dijkstra's Algorithm, allowing for the 
                fastest search possible in the case of this game. Using this search method involved using queues, 
                deques, as well as work lists. Although this was by far the hardest assignment I have received up 
                to date in a computer science course, seeing the game function on my screen was most definitely 
                worth all the effort.
